# Red, White, Blue, and ....Green? Census affect on State Voting

### Data comes from [US Census](https://www.census.gov/topics/income-poverty/income/data/tables.1950.html) and [Harvard Dataverse](https://dataverse.harvard.edu/dataset.xhtml?persistentId=doi:10.7910/DVN/42MVDX)


## Overview
---
This project was attempting to see and understand if there was any relationship between a state's median household income changes over time and affects how that state may vote in the upcoming election.

## Hypothesis Testing
* Null Hypothesis is that there is no relationship between median household income and a state's vote in the presidential election
* Alternative Hypothesis is that there is a relationship between median and household income and a state's vote in the presidential election
* p-value is $a$ = 0.05 as there was not another convincing reason otherwise beyond the standard

### Caveats:
* This data turned out to not be I.I.D. due to previous elections informing and affecting upcoming elections
